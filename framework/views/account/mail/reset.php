<?php echo $account->name ?>,

A request to reset the password for your account has been made at <?php echo $site_url ?>.

You may now log in to <?php echo $site_url ?> by clicking on this link or copying and pasting it in your browser:

<?php echo $reset_url ?>

This is a one-time login, so it can be used only once. It expires after one day and nothing will happen if it's not used.

After logging in, you will be redirected to your account page so you can change your password.

Attention: The username is case sensitive.
